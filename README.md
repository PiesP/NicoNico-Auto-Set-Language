# Description
This user script automatically sets the language on the NicoNico website to Japanese (ja-jp) if it is not already selected. It provides a seamless experience for users who prefer to browse NicoNico in Japanese.

# Why This Script Was Created
The script was developed after noticing an issue where comments were not displayed on certain NicoNico videos. Upon investigation, it was discovered that this issue was caused by the language settingsâ€”only comments in the selected language are displayed. By ensuring the language is set to Japanese, this script resolves the issue and ensures a consistent viewing experience.
